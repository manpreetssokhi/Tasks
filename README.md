# Tasks
Simple todo list - beginner level iOS

From iOS academy tutorial

3 ViewControllers 
- TableView for all tasks
- Task is clicked to get description of task
- Making the entry

Need to implement the "Delete" functionality and add more functionality to the second ViewController (additional notes & deadline)
